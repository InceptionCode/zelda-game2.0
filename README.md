# zelda-game2.0
This application is remake of a previous zelda game that I created here...https://github.com/InceptionCode/zelda-game. The sole purpose here is to remake the zelda-game app all while using react's hooks and potentially react context. This is 100% for learning purposes and to showcase my improvement in overall app architecture and design.

**Reference the old zelda game file for further information on the game and what inspired the idea. Technology used will be similar, difference here is that the application was created with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and utilizes react ~16.8 features/changes... i.e. [hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), and [context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).**

(Additional README changes will be made later...)
