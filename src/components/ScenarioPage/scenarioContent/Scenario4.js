        What option will you choose {props.gameState.playerName}?

        1. Kiss Zelda, throw her your "sword" and run away?
        <br />
        2. Throw "hook" into a window and jump out with Zelda?
        <br />
        3. Take your "pen" and write 'I give up', on Zelda?
        <br />
        4. Wave your "flashlight" and hope help comes?
        <br />
        5. Tie the "rope" onto Zelda and run away?
        <br />
        6. Just "run" away?
